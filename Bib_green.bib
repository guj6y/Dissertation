Species are not isolated, but connected to each others in tangled networks of relationships known as food webs. In this work we want to determine which species are critical as they support many other species. The fact that species are not independent, however, makes the problem difficult to solve. Moreover, the number of possible ``importance'''rankings for species is too high to allow a solution by enumeration. Here we take a ``reverse engineering''approach: we study how we can make biodiversity collapse in the most efficient way in order to investigate which species cause the most damage if removed. We show that adapting the algorithm Google uses for ranking web pages always solves this seemingly intractable problem, finding the most efficient route to collapse. The algorithm works in this sense better than all the others previously proposed and lays the foundation for a complete analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems.},

	N2 = {Many networks exhibit the small-world property of the neighborhood connectivity being higher than in comparable random networks. However, the standard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a node has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally been set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient. Such a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in sparse networks. We propose to include θ as the proportion of leafs and isolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a formula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the Watts and Strogatz(1998 Nature 393 440--2) definition of the clustering coefficient. Excluding leafs and isolated nodes leads to values which are up to 140% higher than the traditional values for the observed networks indicating that neighborhood connectivity is normally underestimated. We find that the definition of the clustering coefficient has a major effect when comparing different networks. For metabolic networks of 43 organisms, relations changed for 58% of the comparisons when a different definition was applied. We also show that the definition influences small-world features and that the classification can change from non-small-world to small-world network. We discuss the use of an alternative measure, disconnectedness D , which is less influenced by leafs and isolated nodes.},

	N2 = {A critical and poorly understood aspect of food?web theory concerns the possibility that variable observation effort, such as widely different sampling intensities among investigators, confounds structural food?web patterns. We evaluated this possibility by simulating the effects of variable observation effort on the structure of a food web including 77 insect species found inside the stems of 10 species of grasses. A highly detailed description of the trophic structure of this community was provided by an exhaustive sampling program involving dissection of 164?215 grass stems over 12 yr. Most significantly, the data describe the frequency at which each of the consumers and their 126 different trophic links were observed. During the simulated increase in sampling, consistent trends were observed among trophic?species webs as the species richness of these webs increased to a maximum of 73 trophic species. Connectance remained surprisingly constant, while the fractions of top and basal species decreased, and the fraction of intermediate species increased. These trends were much less consistent among taxonomic?species webs. This suggests that comparative analyses of connectance among trophic?species webs constructed with varying degrees of moderate observation effort are generally robust. In contrast, the fractions of species appear to require corrections for variable sample sizes for such analyses. These corrections may be easier to develop for trophic?species webs because of their relatively simple changes with sampling effort.},

The webs have four noteworthy attributes: (1) parasites (infectious agents), (2) body?size information, (3) biomass information, and (4) ontogenetic stages of many animals with complex life cycles. The estuaries are Carpinteria Salt Marsh, California (CSM); Estero de Punta Banda, Baja California (EPB); and Bah{\'\i}a Falsa in Bah{\'\i}a San Quint{\'\i}n, Baja California (BSQ). Most data on species assemblages and parasitism were gathered via consistent sampling that acquired body size and biomass information for plants and animals larger than ?1 mm, and for many infectious agents (mostly metazoan parasites, but also some microbes). We augmented this with information from additional published sources and by sampling unrepresented groups (e.g., plankton). We estimated free?living consumer?resource links primarily by extending a previously published version of the CSM web (which the current CSM web supplants) and determined most parasite consumer?resource links from direct observation. We recognize 21 possible link types including four general interactions: predators consuming prey, parasites consuming hosts, predators consuming parasites, and parasites consuming parasites. While generally resolved to the species level, we report stage?specific nodes for many animals with complex life cycles. We include additional biological information for each node, such as taxonomy, lifestyle (free?living, infectious, commensal, mutualist), mobility, and residency. The Metaweb includes 500 nodes, 314 species, and 11?270 links projected to be present given appropriate species' co?occurrences. Of these, 9247 links were present in one or more of the estuarine webs. The remaining 2023 links were not present in the estuaries but are included here because they may occur in other places or times. Initial analyses have examined and are examining the interrelationships among consumer strategy, body size, abundance, biomass, trophic level, life stages, and food?web structure and dynamics. Further use of these data may enable a more general exploration how infectious processes and parasites impact communities and ecosystems. Additionally, we present the data and metadata in a standardized format, attempting to provide a system?neutral template for future food?web assembly and publication.

@article{Lafferty2012,
	Abstract = {Past models have suggested host--parasite coextinction could lead to linear, or concave down relationships between free-living species richness and parasite richness. I explored several models for the relationship between parasite richness and biodiversity loss. Life cycle complexity, low generality of parasites and sensitivity of hosts reduced the robustness of parasite species to the loss of free-living species diversity. Food-web complexity and the ordering of extinctions altered these relationships in unpredictable ways. Each disassembly of a food web resulted in a unique relationship between parasite richness and the richness of free-living species, because the extinction trajectory of parasites was sensitive to the order of extinctions of free-living species. However, the average of many disassemblies tended to approximate an analytical model. Parasites of specialist hosts and hosts higher on food chains were more likely to go extinct in food-web models. Furthermore, correlated extinctions between hosts and parasites (e.g. if parasites share a host with a specialist predator) led to steeper declines in parasite richness with biodiversity loss. In empirical food webs with random removals of free-living species, the relationship between free-living species richness and parasite richness was, on average, quasi-linear, suggesting biodiversity loss reduces parasite diversity more than previously thought.},

@article{Brose2006a,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that differences in body size between consumer and resource species may have important implications for interaction strengths, population dynamics, and eventually food web structure, function, and evolution. Still, the general distribution of consumer--resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean body-size ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator--prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator--prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer--resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

@article{Martinez1991,
	Abstract = {A detailed and relatively evenly resolved food web of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, was constructed to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to the level of detail (degree of resolution) in food-web data. This study presents definitions (e.g., ecosystem food webs) and methods for constructing and reducing the resolution of food webs to provide relatively pragmatic and rigorous touchstones for consistency in future food-web studies. This analysis suggests that food-web patterns such as the scale-invariant links-per-species ratio, short chain lengths, and limited number of trophic levels are constrained by the resolution of food-web data rather than by ecological factors. Patterns less sensitive to changes in resolution such as directed connectance (the proportion of observed directed links to all possible directed links) may be robust food-web attributes. The food web of Little Rock Lake appears to be the first highly and evenly resolved food web of a large natural ecosystem originally documented for the purpose of examining quantitative food-web patterns. This ecosystem food web contains roughly twice as many species as the largest web to date. It also may provide the most credible portrait available of the detailed trophic structure of a whole ecosystem. The 93-trophic-species web of Little Rock Lake differs from previously published trophic-species webs by having more links per species (L/S = 11), longer chain lengths (average: @&gt;10, maximum: @&gt;16), species at higher trophic levels (maximum: = 12), higher fractions of intermediate species, and smaller fractions of top species and links to top species. The sensitivity of quantitative food-web patterns to changes in resolution was examined in several series of tropically aggregated Little Rock Lake webs. Each of the series starts with a highly and relatively evenly resolved web with 182 consumer, producer, and decomposer taxa and ends with low-resolution webs with 9 aggregates of taxa. Taxa were aggregated based on the proportion of predators and prey shared by the taxa. Different series of webs were generated using different criteria for linking aggregates to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to linkage criteria. The sensitivity analysis revealed that several, but not all, quantitative food-web patterns are very sensitive to systematic aggregation of the web. Sensitive patterns include number of links per species, linkage complexity, the distributions of chain lengths and species among trophic levels, and the proportions of top species and links to top species. Less-sensitive patterns include connectance, the ratio of predators to prey, the proportions of intermediate and basal species, and the proportions of links that are between intermediate and basal species. Directed connectance is the only pattern examined that is both very robust to trophic aggregation and generally comparable to other community webs. Quantitative food-web patterns in published community webs are generally similar to highly aggregated Little Rock Lake webs (versions with 9-40 aggregates). These findings suggest that previously described community food webs are severely aggregated versions of more elaborate webs similar to that of Little Rock Lake.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},

abstract={In natural ecosystems, species are linked by feeding interactions that determine energy fluxes and create complex food webs. The stability of these food webs enables many species to coexist and to form diverse ecosystems. Recent theory finds predator-prey body-mass ratios to be critically important for food-web stability. However, the mechanisms responsible for this stability are unclear. Here we use a bioenergetic consumer-resource model to explore how and why only particular predator-prey body-mass ratios promote stability in tri-trophic (three-species) food chains. We find that this 'persistence domain' of ratios is constrained by bottom-up energy availability when predators are much smaller than their prey and by enrichment-driven dynamics when predators are much larger. We also find that 97% of the tri-trophic food chains across five natural food webs exhibit body-mass ratios within the predicted persistence domain. Further analyses of randomly rewired food webs show that body mass and allometric degree distributions in natural food webs mediate this consistency. The allometric degree distributions hold that the diversity of species' predators and prey decreases and increases, respectively, with increasing species' body masses. Our results demonstrate how simple relationships between species' body masses and feeding interactions may promote the stability of complex food webs.},

    abstract = {The niche model has been widely used to model the structure of complex food webs, and yet the ecological meaning of the single niche dimension has not been explored. In the niche model, each species has three traits, niche position, diet position and feeding range. Here, a new probabilistic niche model, which allows the maximum likelihood set of trait values to be estimated for each species, is applied to the food web of the Benguela fishery. We also developed the allometric niche model, in which body size is used as the niche dimension. About 80% of the links in the empirical data are predicted by the probabilistic niche model, a significant improvement over recent models. As in the niche model, species are uniformly distributed on the niche axis. Feeding ranges are exponentially distributed, but diet positions are not uniformly distributed below the predator. Species traits are strongly correlated with body size, but the allometric niche model performs significantly worse than the probabilistic niche model. The best-fit parameter set provides a significantly better model of the structure of the Benguela food web than was previously available. The methodology allows the identification of a number of taxa that stand out as outliers either in the model's poor performance at predicting their predators or prey or in their parameter values. While important, body size alone does not explain the structure of the one-dimensional niche.},

abstract={Energetics may provide a useful currency for studying the ecology of parasite assemblages within individual hosts. Parasite assemblages may also provide powerful models to study general principles of ecological energetics. Yet there has been little ecological research on parasite-host energetics, probably due to methodological difficulties. However, the scaling relationships of individual metabolic rate with body or cell size and temperature may permit us to tackle the energetics of parasite assemblages in hosts. This article offers the foundations and initial testing of a metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) framework for parasites in hosts. I first provide equations to estimate energetic flux through observed parasite assemblages. I then develop metabolic scaling theory for parasite abundance, energetics, and biomass in individual hosts. In contrast to previous efforts, the theory factors in both host and parasite metabolic scaling, how parasites use host space, and whether energy or space dictates carrying capacity. Empirical tests indicate that host energetic flux can set parasite carrying capacity, which decreases as predicted considering the scaling of host and parasite metabolic rates. The theory and results also highlight that the phenomenon of "energetic equivalence" is not an assumption of MTE but a possible outcome contingent on how species partition resources. Hence, applying MTE to parasites can lend mechanistic, quantitative, predictive insight into the nature of parasitism and can inform general ecological theory.;Energetics may provide a useful currency for studying the ecology of parasite assemblages within individual hosts.

abstract={Most studies of plant-animal mutualisms involve a small number of species. There is almost no information on the structural organization of species-rich mutualistic networks despite its potential importance for the maintenance of diversity. Here we analyze 52 mutualistic networks and show that they are highly nested; that is, the more specialist species interact only with proper subsets of those species interacting with the more generalists. This assembly pattern generates highly asymmetrical interactions and organizes the community cohesively around a central core of interactions. Thus, mutualistic networks are neither randomly assembled nor organized in compartments arising from tight, parallel specialization. Furthermore, nestedness increases with the complexity (number of interactions) of the network: for a given number of species, communities with more interactions are significantly more nested. Our results indicate a nonrandom pattern of community organization that may be relevant for our understanding of the organization and persistence of biodiversity.},

journal={Functional Ecology},

volume={26},

pages={1262-1274},

abstract={1. Introduced species disrupt native communities and biodiversity worldwide. Parasitic infections (and at times, their absence) are thought to be a key component in the success and impact of biological invasions by plants and animals. They can facilitate or limit invasions, and positively or negatively impact native species. 2. Parasites have not only direct effects on their hosts, but also indirect effects on the species with which their hosts interact. Indirect effects include density-mediated effects (resulting from parasite-induced reduction in host reproduction and survival) as well as trait-mediated indirect effects (resulting from parasite-induced changes in host phenotype, behaviour or life history). These effects are not mutually exclusive but often interact. 3. The importance of these indirect interactions for invasion success, and the extent to which these effects ramify throughout communities and influence ecosystems undergoing biological invasion provide the focus of our review. Examples from the animal and plant literature illustrate the importance of parasites in mediating both competitive and consumerresource interactions between native and invasive species. 4. Parasites are involved in indirect interactions at all trophic levels. Furthermore, the indirect effects of parasitic infection are important at a range of biological scales from within a host to the whole ecosystem in determining invasion success and impact. 5. To understand the importance of parasitic infection in invasion success and in the outcomes for invaded communities requires an interdisciplinary approach by ecologists and parasitologists, across animal and plant systems. Future research should develop a framework integrating community ecology, evolution and immunology to better understand and manage the spread of invasive species and their diseases.},

title={Disease risks and overabundance of game species},

journal={European Journal of Wildlife Research},

volume={52},

number={2},

pages={81-87},

abstract={Different studies have evidenced the relationship between host abundance and health status of wildlife populations. Diseases that benefit from wildlife overabundance can affect not only the fitness and trophy quality of game species, but also public health, livestock health, and the conservation of endangered species. This paper reviews a number of European examples to highlight the relationship between overabundance and disease in game species, and discusses the possibilities of limiting the associated risks. Management tools to estimate overabundance are needed for legislative purposes and for the monitoring of wildlife populations, but artificial feeding interferes in the objective measurement of overabundance. Therefore, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose if a given wildlife population is overabundant. This includes not only signs such as adverse effects on the soil, vegetation or fauna (first group), poor body condition scores, low trophy scores or low reproductive performance (second group), or increased parasite burdens (third group), but also the measurement of infectious disease prevalences (the fourth group of overabundance signs). This combined assessment of overabundance ideally requires the cooperation of wildlife managers, botanists, and veterinarians. Once a given wildlife population is defined as overabundant, it is difficult to establish palliative management actions. These can consist in banning certain management tools (e.g. feeding) or increasing the hunting harvest, but both of them are difficult to implement in practice. A close monitoring of both wildlife densities and wildlife diseases, the establishment of reference values for all signs of overabundance, and the mapping of the disease and density hotspots will be needed to design adequate risk-control measures for each particular situation.},

title={Invariant properties in coevolutionary networks of plant-animal interactions},

journal={Ecology Letters},

volume={6},

number={1},

pages={69-81},

abstract={Plant-animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.},

title={Developing a high taxonomic resolution food web model to assess the functional role of forage fish in the California Current ecosystem},

journal={Ecological Modelling},

volume={335},

pages={87-100},

abstract={Understanding the role of forage fish in marine food webs is an important part of ecosystem-based fisheries management. Food web models are a common tool used to account for important characteristics of forage fish and their trophodynamics. One primary limitation of many existing food web models is that the taxonomic resolution of forage fish and their predators is overly simplified. Here, we developed a food web model with high taxonomic resolution of forage fish and their predators in the California Current to more comprehensively describe trophic linkages involving forage fish and examine the ecological role of forage fish in this system. We parameterized a mass-balanced food web model (Ecopath) with 92 living functional groups, and used this to quantify diet dependency on forage fish, determine the main predators of forage fish, identify the topological position of forage fish in the food web, and calculate an index that identifies forage species or species aggregations that have key ecological roles (Supportive Role to Fishery ecosystem, SURF). Throughout, we characterized parameter uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach. Though diets revealed some predators had high diet dependencies on individual forage fish species, most predators consumed multiple forage fish and also had notable diet overlap with forage fish. Consequently, no single forage fish appeared to act as a vital nexus species that is characteristic of "wasp-waisted" food webs in other upwelling regions. Additionally, no single forage fish was identified as "key" by the SURF index, but if predators and fisheries view certain pairs of forage fish as functionally equivalent, some plausible pairs would be identified as key assemblages. Specifically, sardine & anchovy (Sardinops sagax & Engraulis mordax) and herring & anchovy (Clupea pallasii & E. mordax) are key when predator populations depend on the aggregate availability of these species. This food web model can be used to support generalized equilibrium trade-off analysis or dynamic modeling to identify specific predators that would be of conservation concern under conditions of future forage fish depletion.},

title={Parasites and ecosystem energy flow},

abstract={In this dissertation I argue that the best way to include parasites into ecological studies is by using the direct energetic costs of parasites at the individual, population, and community levels. Thus, the objective of this dissertation was to determine the direct and indirect energetic costs of parasitism within individuals, populations, and communities of hosts to assess their functional roles. To determine the energetic effects of parasites, field surveys, bomb calorimetry, and respirometry were used to create energy budgets for all species collected from streams of the New Jersey Pinelands, including all parasites. The most common parasite was Acanthocephalus tehlequahensis. At the individual and population level, this parasite significantly altered the energy allocation patterns in its isopod intermediate host and extracted 6.7% of the production energy from the isopod population (infected and uninfected hosts). However, in the definitive host, the parasite had little effect on energy allocation, and there were no significant differences in the energy budgets between infected and uninfected pirate perch hosts infected with A. tehlequahensis and the trematode Phyllodsitomum sp., and parasites within the fish population received 1.3% of the host’s production energy. At the ecosystem level, energy budgets were created within two pineland streams, one with a high-level of parasitism and one with a low level of parasitism. Parasites extracted a small amount of energy from both streams (<1%), but proportionally less energy went to parasitism in the stream with low levels of parasitism. Parasite establishment may be constrained by energy flow through the food web because little energy makes it up the food web to trophic positions that parasites inhabit. This study also demonstrated that parasite species may derive their energy from many trophic levels within a food web even if they co-occur in the same host. The results of this dissertation suggest that parasites extract a small amount of energy from their hosts at all levels of ecological organization. The effects of parasites are larger because they alter energy allocation patterns of their hosts. An overall conclusion is that energetic constraints limit parasite establishment and maintenance at the ecosystem level.},

abstract={This analysis of 11 large community food webs shows that food web structure systematically varies as the trophic resolution of food web data is reduced. Mean chain length, the ratio of links per species, and the fractions of intermediate species and links between intermediate species decrease as the trophic-species webs are aggregated to half their size. Concurrently, the fractions of top species, basal species, and links between top and basal species increase. Directed connectance and the predator/prey ratio appear to be relatively robust to reducing the trophic resolution of food web data. Significant effects of reducing the taxonomic resolution of food webs are also demonstrated. These findings are inconsistent with prominent claims that most properties are robust to varying the resolution of food web data. Problems responsible for this inconsistency are identified.},

pages={349-351},

abstract={Ecological theory predicts that a complex community formed by a number of species is inherently unstable, guiding ecologists to identify what maintains species diversity in nature. Earlier studies often assumed a community with only one interaction type, either an antagonistic, competitive, or mutualistic interaction, leaving open the question of what the diversity of interaction types contributes to the community maintenance. We show theoretically that the multiple interaction types might hold the key to understanding community dynamics. A moderate mixture of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics. Furthermore, increasing complexity leads to increased stability in a "hybrid" community. We hypothesize that the diversity of species and interaction types may be the essential element of biodiversity that maintains ecological communities.},

abstract={Recent reviews of plant-pollinator mutualistic networks showed that generalization is a common pattern in this type of interaction. Here we examine the ecological correlates of generalization patterns in plant-pollinator networks, especially how interaction patterns covary with latitude, elevation, and insularity. We review the few published analyses of whole networks and include unpublished material, analyzing 29 complete plant-pollinator networks that encompass arctic, alpine, temperate, Mediterranean, and subtropical-tropical areas. The number of interactions observed (I) was a linear function of network size (M) the maximum number of interactions: In I = 0.575 + 0.61 In M; R2 = 0.946. The connectance (C), the fraction of observed interactions relative to the total possible, decreased exponentially with species richness, the sum of animal and plant species in each community (A + P): C = 13.83 exp[ -0.003(A + P)]. After controlling for species richness, the residual connectance was significantly lower in highland (>1500 m elevation) than in lowland networks and differed marginally among biogeographic regions, with both alpine and tropical networks showing a trend for lower residual connectance. The two Mediterranean networks showed the highest residual connectance. After correcting for variation in network size, plant species were shown to be more generalized at higher latitude and lowland habitats, but showed increased specialization on islands. Oceanic island networks showed an impoverishment of potential animal pollinators (lower ratio of animal to plant species, A : P, compared to mainland networks) associated with this trend of increased specialization. Plants, but not their flower-visiting animals, supported the often-repeated statements about higher specificity in the tropics than at higher latitudes. The pattern of interaction build-up as diversity increases in pollination networks does not differ appreciably from other mutualisms, such as plant-seed disperser networks or more complex food webs.},

abstract={In natural communities, species and their interactions are often organized as nonrandom networks, showing distinct and repeated complex patterns. A prevalent, but poorly explored pattern is ecological modularity, with weakly interlinked subsets of species (modules), which, however, internally consist of strongly connected species. The importance of modularity has been discussed for a long time, but no consensus on its prevalence in ecological networks has yet been reached. Progress is hampered by inadequate methods and a lack of large datasets. We analyzed 51 pollination networks including almost 10,000 species and 20,000 links and tested for modularity by using a recently developed simulated annealing algorithm. All networks with >150 plant and pollinator species were modular, whereas networks with <50 species were never modular. Both module number and size increased with species number. Each module includes one or a few species groups with convergent trait sets that may be considered as coevolutionary units. Species played different roles with respect to modularity. However, only 15% of all species were structurally important to their network. They were either hubs (i.e., highly linked species within their own module), connectors linking different modules, or both. If these key species go extinct, modules and networks may break apart and initiate cascades of extinction. Thus, species serving as hubs and connectors should receive high conservation priorities. coevolution compartment module nestedness species role.},

number={3},

pages={559-568},

abstract={  Although veterinary authorities aim to limit persistence of classical swine fever (CSF) in wild boar (Sus scrofa), to avoid potential transmission to pigs, factors influencing CSF transmission and persistence are not clearly understood. Here we analyse incidence and persistence in a CSF epidemic that occurred in the French Vosges Forest. Higher incidence was found in large forests compared to smaller isolated ones, being highest near the starting point of the epidemic, but poorly related to the local density. We hypothesize that the spatial and social structure of wild boar populations may be responsible for this variability of incidence over space. Persistence was highest near the starting point of the epidemic and where initial density was highest. We hypothesize that persistence was favoured by the abundance of young wild boar, itself encouraged by CSF. Our results allow us to propose management measures aimed at limiting CSF persistence.

pages={243-253},

abstract={Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is considered as the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in domestic pigs, where the virus is ubiquitous as evidenced by serological surveys. We present the results of the first nationwide sero-survey on the presence of PCV2 antibodies in European wild boars, and report the first PMWS case in a wild boar from Spain. Sera from 656 hunter harvested wild boars from 45 different geographical sites and 22 additional imported animals were analysed by means of an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). We also examined the tissues from 55 healthy and one diseased wild boars for the presence of PCV2 nucleic acid and PMWS lesions by in situ hybridisation and histopathology, respectively. Additionally, abundance estimates of wild boars and field interviews were carried out on 30 sampling sites. The prevalence of medium to high PCV2 serological titres among the examined wild boars was 47.89 +/- 1.9%. Seropositive wild boars appeared in all but one of the geographical regions analysed. Seroprevalence and titre of PCV2 antibodies were closely related to the management of the wild boar populations. Wild boars from intensively managed, farm-like populations had higher prevalence than wild boars living in more natural situations. The effect of wild boar abundance and management on PCV2 antibody prevalence was further evidenced by the high correlation existing between the relative abundance estimates of animals and the percentage of wild boars with medium to high levels of PCV2 antibodies. PCV2 nucleic acid was detected in the tissues of three wild boars. One of these was diagnosed as PMWS. The results, in addition to information on piglet mortalities, suggest a potential role of PMWS in piglet mortality in intensively managed wild boar populations.},

abstract={Parasites can have strong impacts but are thought to contribute little biomass to ecosystems. We quantified the biomass of free-living and parasitic species in three estuaries on the Pacific coast of California and Baja California. Here we show that parasites have substantial biomass in these ecosystems. We found that parasite biomass exceeded that of top predators. The biomass of trematodes was particularly high, being comparable to that of the abundant birds, fishes, burrowing shrimps and polychaetes. Trophically transmitted parasites and parasitic castrators subsumed more biomass than did other parasitic functional groups. The extended phenotype biomass controlled by parasitic castrators sometimes exceeded that of their uninfected hosts. The annual production of free-swimming trematode transmission stages was greater than the combined biomass of all quantified parasites and was also greater than bird biomass. This biomass and productivity of parasites implies a profound role for infectious processes in these estuaries.},

pages={9335-9339},

abstract={Parasites often play an important role in modifying the physiology and behavior of their hosts and may, consequently, mediate the influence hosts have on other components of an ecological community. Along the northern Atlantic coast of North America, the dominant herbivorous snail Littorina littorea structures rocky intertidal communities through strong grazing pressure and is frequently parasitized by the digenean trematode Cryptocotyle lingua. We hypothesized that the effects of parasitism on host physiology would induce behavioral changes in L. littorea, which in turn would modulate L. littorea's influence on intertidal community composition. Specifically, we hypothesized that C. lingua infection would alter the grazing rate of L. littorea and, consequently, macroalgal communities would develop differently in the presence of infected versus uninfected snails. Our results show that uninfected snails consumed 40% more ephemeral macroalgal biomass than infected snails in the laboratory, probably because the digestive system of infected snails is compromised by C. lingua infection. In the field, this weaker grazing by infected snails resulted in significantly greater expansion of ephemeral macroalgal cover relative to grazing by uninfected snails. By decreasing the per-capita grazing rate of the dominant herbivore, C. lingua indirectly affects the composition of the macroalgal community and may in turn affect other species that depend on macroalgae for resources or habitat structure. In light of the abundance of parasites across systems, we suggest that, through trait-mediated indirect effects, parasites may be a common determinant of structure in ecological communities.},

abstract={1. A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press perturbations in multispecies ecological communities; with relatively modest requirements for data, is explicated. The approach uses energetic and allometric reasoning to set some parameter values for which data are not available. The remaining unknown parameters are treated as random variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the outcomes that are of interest. 2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial. 3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated. Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found, indicating that 44% of all links could be deleted from the foodweb without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model. This is a very helpful (and encouraging) result for the design of an observational protocol for systematic efforts to gather data for multispecies modelling.},
