Species are not isolated, but connected to each others in tangled networks of relationships known as food webs. In this work we want to determine which species are critical as they support many other species. The fact that species are not independent, however, makes the problem difficult to solve. Moreover, the number of possible ``importance'''rankings for species is too high to allow a solution by enumeration. Here we take a ``reverse engineering''approach: we study how we can make biodiversity collapse in the most efficient way in order to investigate which species cause the most damage if removed. We show that adapting the algorithm Google uses for ranking web pages always solves this seemingly intractable problem, finding the most efficient route to collapse. The algorithm works in this sense better than all the others previously proposed and lays the foundation for a complete analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems.},

	N2 = {Many networks exhibit the small-world property of the neighborhood connectivity being higher than in comparable random networks. However, the standard measure of local neighborhood clustering is typically not defined if a node has one or no neighbors. In such cases, local clustering has traditionally been set to zero and this value influenced the global clustering coefficient. Such a procedure leads to underestimation of the neighborhood clustering in sparse networks. We propose to include θ as the proportion of leafs and isolated nodes to estimate the contribution of these cases and provide a formula for estimating a clustering coefficient excluding these cases from the Watts and Strogatz(1998 Nature 393 440--2) definition of the clustering coefficient. Excluding leafs and isolated nodes leads to values which are up to 140% higher than the traditional values for the observed networks indicating that neighborhood connectivity is normally underestimated. We find that the definition of the clustering coefficient has a major effect when comparing different networks. For metabolic networks of 43 organisms, relations changed for 58% of the comparisons when a different definition was applied. We also show that the definition influences small-world features and that the classification can change from non-small-world to small-world network. We discuss the use of an alternative measure, disconnectedness D , which is less influenced by leafs and isolated nodes.},

	N2 = {A critical and poorly understood aspect of food?web theory concerns the possibility that variable observation effort, such as widely different sampling intensities among investigators, confounds structural food?web patterns. We evaluated this possibility by simulating the effects of variable observation effort on the structure of a food web including 77 insect species found inside the stems of 10 species of grasses. A highly detailed description of the trophic structure of this community was provided by an exhaustive sampling program involving dissection of 164?215 grass stems over 12 yr. Most significantly, the data describe the frequency at which each of the consumers and their 126 different trophic links were observed. During the simulated increase in sampling, consistent trends were observed among trophic?species webs as the species richness of these webs increased to a maximum of 73 trophic species. Connectance remained surprisingly constant, while the fractions of top and basal species decreased, and the fraction of intermediate species increased. These trends were much less consistent among taxonomic?species webs. This suggests that comparative analyses of connectance among trophic?species webs constructed with varying degrees of moderate observation effort are generally robust. In contrast, the fractions of species appear to require corrections for variable sample sizes for such analyses. These corrections may be easier to develop for trophic?species webs because of their relatively simple changes with sampling effort.},

The webs have four noteworthy attributes: (1) parasites (infectious agents), (2) body?size information, (3) biomass information, and (4) ontogenetic stages of many animals with complex life cycles. The estuaries are Carpinteria Salt Marsh, California (CSM); Estero de Punta Banda, Baja California (EPB); and Bah{\'\i}a Falsa in Bah{\'\i}a San Quint{\'\i}n, Baja California (BSQ). Most data on species assemblages and parasitism were gathered via consistent sampling that acquired body size and biomass information for plants and animals larger than ?1 mm, and for many infectious agents (mostly metazoan parasites, but also some microbes). We augmented this with information from additional published sources and by sampling unrepresented groups (e.g., plankton). We estimated free?living consumer?resource links primarily by extending a previously published version of the CSM web (which the current CSM web supplants) and determined most parasite consumer?resource links from direct observation. We recognize 21 possible link types including four general interactions: predators consuming prey, parasites consuming hosts, predators consuming parasites, and parasites consuming parasites. While generally resolved to the species level, we report stage?specific nodes for many animals with complex life cycles. We include additional biological information for each node, such as taxonomy, lifestyle (free?living, infectious, commensal, mutualist), mobility, and residency. The Metaweb includes 500 nodes, 314 species, and 11?270 links projected to be present given appropriate species' co?occurrences. Of these, 9247 links were present in one or more of the estuarine webs. The remaining 2023 links were not present in the estuaries but are included here because they may occur in other places or times. Initial analyses have examined and are examining the interrelationships among consumer strategy, body size, abundance, biomass, trophic level, life stages, and food?web structure and dynamics. Further use of these data may enable a more general exploration how infectious processes and parasites impact communities and ecosystems. Additionally, we present the data and metadata in a standardized format, attempting to provide a system?neutral template for future food?web assembly and publication.

@article{Lafferty2012,
	Abstract = {Past models have suggested host--parasite coextinction could lead to linear, or concave down relationships between free-living species richness and parasite richness. I explored several models for the relationship between parasite richness and biodiversity loss. Life cycle complexity, low generality of parasites and sensitivity of hosts reduced the robustness of parasite species to the loss of free-living species diversity. Food-web complexity and the ordering of extinctions altered these relationships in unpredictable ways. Each disassembly of a food web resulted in a unique relationship between parasite richness and the richness of free-living species, because the extinction trajectory of parasites was sensitive to the order of extinctions of free-living species. However, the average of many disassemblies tended to approximate an analytical model. Parasites of specialist hosts and hosts higher on food chains were more likely to go extinct in food-web models. Furthermore, correlated extinctions between hosts and parasites (e.g. if parasites share a host with a specialist predator) led to steeper declines in parasite richness with biodiversity loss. In empirical food webs with random removals of free-living species, the relationship between free-living species richness and parasite richness was, on average, quasi-linear, suggesting biodiversity loss reduces parasite diversity more than previously thought.},

@article{Brose2006a,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that differences in body size between consumer and resource species may have important implications for interaction strengths, population dynamics, and eventually food web structure, function, and evolution. Still, the general distribution of consumer--resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean body-size ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator--prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator--prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer--resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

@article{Martinez1991,
	Abstract = {A detailed and relatively evenly resolved food web of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin, was constructed to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to the level of detail (degree of resolution) in food-web data. This study presents definitions (e.g., ecosystem food webs) and methods for constructing and reducing the resolution of food webs to provide relatively pragmatic and rigorous touchstones for consistency in future food-web studies. This analysis suggests that food-web patterns such as the scale-invariant links-per-species ratio, short chain lengths, and limited number of trophic levels are constrained by the resolution of food-web data rather than by ecological factors. Patterns less sensitive to changes in resolution such as directed connectance (the proportion of observed directed links to all possible directed links) may be robust food-web attributes. The food web of Little Rock Lake appears to be the first highly and evenly resolved food web of a large natural ecosystem originally documented for the purpose of examining quantitative food-web patterns. This ecosystem food web contains roughly twice as many species as the largest web to date. It also may provide the most credible portrait available of the detailed trophic structure of a whole ecosystem. The 93-trophic-species web of Little Rock Lake differs from previously published trophic-species webs by having more links per species (L/S = 11), longer chain lengths (average: @&gt;10, maximum: @&gt;16), species at higher trophic levels (maximum: = 12), higher fractions of intermediate species, and smaller fractions of top species and links to top species. The sensitivity of quantitative food-web patterns to changes in resolution was examined in several series of tropically aggregated Little Rock Lake webs. Each of the series starts with a highly and relatively evenly resolved web with 182 consumer, producer, and decomposer taxa and ends with low-resolution webs with 9 aggregates of taxa. Taxa were aggregated based on the proportion of predators and prey shared by the taxa. Different series of webs were generated using different criteria for linking aggregates to evaluate the sensitivity of food-web patterns to linkage criteria. The sensitivity analysis revealed that several, but not all, quantitative food-web patterns are very sensitive to systematic aggregation of the web. Sensitive patterns include number of links per species, linkage complexity, the distributions of chain lengths and species among trophic levels, and the proportions of top species and links to top species. Less-sensitive patterns include connectance, the ratio of predators to prey, the proportions of intermediate and basal species, and the proportions of links that are between intermediate and basal species. Directed connectance is the only pattern examined that is both very robust to trophic aggregation and generally comparable to other community webs. Quantitative food-web patterns in published community webs are generally similar to highly aggregated Little Rock Lake webs (versions with 9-40 aggregates). These findings suggest that previously described community food webs are severely aggregated versions of more elaborate webs similar to that of Little Rock Lake.},

@article{Stouffer2005,
	Abstract = {Understanding the structure of food webs, and the mechanisms that give rise to this structure, is one of the most challenging problems in ecology. We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient. Our results strongly support two hypotheses: first, that any model satisfying the two conditions we identify will accurately reproduce a number of the statistical properties of empirical food webs, and second, that the empirical distributions of number of prey and number of predators follow universal functional forms that, without free parameters, match our analytical predictions.},
